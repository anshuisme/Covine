Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with
fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these
objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person
with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person.
The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
a mild cough and does not feel ill. Protect yourself and those around you: Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn and follow local guidance on vaccination.
Keep physical distance of at least 1 metre from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick. Avoid crowds and close contact.
Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible and in poorly ventilated settings.
Clean your hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
Cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of used tissues immediately and clean hands regularly. 
If you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate until you recover.
Wear a mask properly To properly wear your mask: Make sure your mask covers your nose, mouth and chin.
Clean your hands before you put your mask on, before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
When you take off your mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask or dispose of it in a trash bin if it’s a medical mask.
Don’t use masks with valves. More about masks: When and how to wear masks Questions and answers about children and masks Guidance for decision makers and health workers Make your environment safer
The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity.
Outbreaks have been reported in places where people have gather, often in crowded indoor settings and where they talk loudly, shout, breathe heavily or sing such as restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and places of worship.
Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close contact.
Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones, particularly if indoor spaces are small and without outdoor air coming in.
If you can’t avoid crowded or indoor settings, take these precautions:Open a window to increase the amount of natural ventilation when indoors.Wear a mask (see above for more details). More on: Small public gatherings Ventilation and air conditioning (for the general public) Ventilation and air conditioning (for people who manage public spaces and buildings) Keep good hygiene By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses that cause colds, flu and COVID-19. 
To ensure good hygiene you should:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with either an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. This eliminates germs that may be on your hands, including viruses.
Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands.
Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently, especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens.
If you feel unwell, here’s what to do. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately. Call by telephone first and follow the directions of your local health authority.
Know the full range of symptoms of COVID-19. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, tiredness and loss of taste or smell. Less common symptoms include aches and pains, headache, sore throat, red or irritated eyes, diarrhoea,  a skin rash or discolouration of fingers or toes.
Stay home and self-isolate for 10 days from symptom onset, plus three days after symptoms cease. Call your health care provider or hotline for advice. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house or have someone near you, wear a properly fitted mask to avoid infecting others.
Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Local and national authorities and public health units are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.
Get Vaccinated and stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing you from getting sick. COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death.
Getting vaccinated is the best way to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.CDC recommends that everyone who is eligible stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines, including people with weakened immune systems.
head side mask light icon Wear a mask Everyone ages 2 years and older should properly wear a well-fitting mask indoors in public in areas of substantial or high community transmission, regardless of vaccination status.
You might choose to wear a mask regardless of the level of community transmission, if you or someone in your household is at increased risk for severe disease or has a weakened immune system, or if someone in your household is not up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines or not eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines.
Improve how well your mask protects you, and learn about how to choose a mask to protect yourself and others. In general, people do not need to wear masks when outdoors. In areas of substantial or high transmission, people might choose to wear a mask outdoors when in sustained close contact with other people, particularly if
They or someone they live with has a weakened immune system or is at increased risk for severe disease. They are not up to date on COVID-19 vaccines or live with someone who is not up to date on COVID-19 vaccines.
People who have a condition or are taking medications that weaken their immune system may not be fully protected even if they are up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines. They should continue to take all precautions recommended for unvaccinated people, including properly wearing a well-fitted mask, until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider.
For more information, see COVID-19 Vaccines for Moderately or Severely Immunocompromised People Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and while indoors at U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations. Travelers are not required to wear a mask in outdoor areas of a conveyance (like on open deck areas of a ferry or the uncovered top deck of a bus).
Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick, if possible. If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members. If you are taking care of someone who is sick, make sure you properly wear a well-fitting mask and follow other steps to protect yourself.
Indoors in public: If you are not up to date on COVID-19 vaccines, stay at least 6 feet away from other people, especially if you are at higher risk of getting very sick with COVID-19.
Avoid poorly ventilated spaces and crowds If indoors, bring in fresh air by opening windows and doors, if possible. If you are at increased risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, avoid crowded places and indoor spaces that do not have fresh air from the outdoors.
virus light icon Test to prevent spread to others You can choose from many different types of tests.Tests for SARS-CoV-2(the virus that causes COVID-19) tell you if you have an infection at the time of the test. This type of test is called a viral test because it looks for viral infection.
Regardless of the test type you select, a positive test result means that you have an infection and should isolate and inform your close contacts to avoid spreading disease to others.
Over-the-counter self-tests are viral tests that can be used at home or anywhere, are easy to use, and produce rapid results. Anyone can use self-tests, regardless of their vaccination status or whether they have symptoms.
COVID-19 self-tests are one of many risk-reduction measures, along with vaccination, masking, and physical distancing, that protect you and others by reducing the chances of spreading COVID-19.
hands wash light icon Wash your hands often Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. It’s especially important to wash your hands: Before eating or preparing food Before touching your face After using the restroom After leaving a public place After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing After handling your mask After changing a diaper After caring for someone sick After touching animals or pets If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. box tissue light icon Cover coughs and sneezes If you are wearing a mask: You can cough or sneeze into your mask. Put on a new, clean mask as soon as possible and wash your hands. If you are not wearing a mask: Always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, or use the inside of your elbow and do not spit. Throw used tissues in the trash. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
spraybottle icon Clean and disinfect Clean high touch surfaces regularly or as needed and after you have visitors in your home. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If someone is sick or has tested positive for COVID-19, disinfect frequently touched surfaces. Use a household disinfectant product from EPA’s List N: Disinfectants for Coronavirus (COVID-19)external icon
Monitor your health daily Be alert for symptoms: Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19.
Take your temperature if symptoms develop. Don’t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen.
Follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop. Monitoring symptoms is especially important if you are running errands, going into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a physical distance of 6 feet.
FACT: Alcohol-based sanitizers are safe for everyone to use
Alcohols in the sanitizers have not been shown to create any relevant health issues. Little alcohol is absorbed into the skin, and most products contain an emollient to reduce skin dryness. Allergic contact dermatitis and bleaching of hand hair due to alcohol are very rare adverse effects. Accidental swallowing and intoxication have been described in rare cases.
FACT: Hand sanitizers can be used often
An alcohol-based sanitizer does not create antibiotic resistance. Unlike other antiseptics and antibiotics, pathogens (harmful germs) do not seem to develop resistance to alcohol-based sanitizers.
FACT: Alcohol-based sanitizers can be used in religions where alcohol is prohibited
Any manufactured substance developed to alleviate illness or contribute to better health is permitted by the Qur'an, including alcohol used as a medical agent. 
FACT: The amount of alcohol-based sanitizer you use matters
Apply a palmful of alcohol-based sanitizer to cover all surfaces of your hands. Rub your hands together using the right technique until they are dry.
The entire procedure should last 20-30 seconds
FACT: It is safer to frequently clean your hands and not wear gloves
Wearing gloves risks transferring germs from one surface to another and contaminating your hands when removing them. Wearing gloves does not replace cleaning hands. Health workers wear gloves only for specific tasks.
FACT: Touching a communal bottle of alcohol-based sanitizer will not infect you
Once you've sanitized your hands, you have disinfected them from any germs that may have been on the bottle. If everyone uses sanitizer in a public place such as a supermarket entrance, the risk of germs on communal items will be lower and will help keep everyone safe.
FACT: An alcohol-based handrub is listed as a WHO essential medicine
Clean hands protect patients, health workers, other caregivers and everyone from infection. Cleaning your hands is one of the key measures to prevent disease.
FACT: Clinical trials confirm that hydroxychloroquine does not prevent illness or death from COVID-19.
Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, a common treatment for malaria and certain autoimmune diseases, has been studied as a preventative treatment for COVID-19. Evidence from these studies shows that hydroxychloroquine has little to no impact on illness, hospitalization, or death. 
FACT: Vitamin and mineral supplements cannot cure COVID-19 
Micronutrients, such as vitamins D and C and zinc, are critical for a well-functioning immune system and play a vital role in promoting health and nutritional well-being.  There is currently no guidance on the use of micronutrient supplements as a treatment of COVID-19.
WHO is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat COVID-19.
Is dexamethasone a treatment for all COVID-19 patients?
Dexamethasone should be reserved for patients who need it most. It should not be stockpiled.
It provided no improvement for patients with mild symptoms. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. For some COVID-19 patients on ventilators, a daily 6 mg dose of dexamethasone for 10 days improved their health
Fact: Water or swimming does not transmit the COVID-19 virus
The COVID-19 virus does not transmit through water while swimming. However, the virus spreads between people when someone has close contact with an infected person. 
WHAT YOU CAN DO:
Avoid crowds and maintain at least a 1-metre distance from others, even when you are swimming or at swimming areas. Wear a mask when you’re not in the water and you can’t stay distant. Clean your hands frequently, cover a cough or sneeze with a tissue or bent elbow, and stay home if you’re unwell.
FACT: The likelihood of shoes spreading COVID-19 is very low
The likelihood of COVID-19 being spread on shoes and infecting individuals is very low. As a precautionary measure, particularly in homes where infants and small children crawl or play on floors, consider leaving your shoes at the entrance of your home. This will help prevent contact with dirt or any waste  that could be carried on the soles of shoes.
FACT: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a virus, NOT by bacteria
The virus that causes COVID-19 is in a family of viruses called Coronaviridae. Antibiotics do not work against viruses.
Some people who become ill with COVID-19 can also develop a bacterial infection as a complication. In this case, antibiotics may be recommended by a health care provider.
There is currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19. If you have symptoms, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for assistance.
FACT: The prolonged use of medical masks* when properly worn, DOES NOT cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency
The prolonged use of medical masks can be uncomfortable. However, it does not lead to CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency. While wearing a medical mask, make sure it fits properly and that it is tight enough to allow you to breathe normally. Do not re-use a disposable mask and always change it as soon as it gets damp.
Medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are flat or pleated; they are affixed to the head with straps or have ear loops.
FACT: Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous
The harmful use of alcohol increases your risk of health problems.
FACT: Thermal scanners CANNOT detect COVID-19
Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature). They cannot detect people who are infected with COVID-19. There are many causes of fever. Call your healthcare provider if you need assistance or seek immediate medical care if you have fever and live in an area with malaria or dengue.
